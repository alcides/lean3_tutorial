## What is LEAN?

Lean is a programming language + compiler that also works as a interactive theorem prover. Lean is being developed by Microsoft and the project is led by Leonardo de Moura of Z3's fame.

We will be covering Lean 3, the latest stable version. Lean 4 is being developed without external contributions at this time.
